<div><span data-custom-class="body_text">We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other&nbsp;unauthorized&nbsp;third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the Services.

<div><strong><span data-custom-class="heading_1">12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</span></strong></div>
<div><span data-custom-class="body_text">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for&nbsp;recognizing&nbsp;and implementing DNT signals has been&nbsp;finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</span></div>
<div><span data-custom-class="body_text">California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for&nbsp;recognizing&nbsp;or&nbsp;honoring&nbsp;DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</span></div>
