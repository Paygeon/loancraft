License Agreement
lendingstack uses two different licenses for our products - The Standard License and the MIT License. The type of license you need depends on the type of product (=also referred to as 'work', 'component', 'module', 'template', 'boilerplate', 'function', or their respective plural versions) and is being displayed on a product's page. Generally speaking, all paid products require a Standard License, while all free products operate under the MIT License. If in doubt about the terms or about your use case, please contact us at [support@lendingstack.com].
